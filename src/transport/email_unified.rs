//! Email transport: SMTP send, SMTP-server receive (Direct mode); relay/smart-host SMTP send and
//! IMAP-polling receive (RelayOut/External modes).
//!
//! # Three modes, chosen at construction
//!
//! [`EmailMode`] is decided once, in [`EmailTransportImpl::new`], from
//! [`ConnectivityDetector::assess_connectivity`] -- unless the config map's `email_mode` key names
//! one explicitly (`"direct"`/`"relay_out"`/`"external"`), which skips the detector entirely. That
//! override exists for two reasons: an operator who already knows their network shape (e.g. "this
//! box is firewalled, don't bother probing") can say so directly, and it is the only way to test
//! RelayOut/External deterministically -- `ConnectivityDetector::assess_connectivity` probes fixed
//! ports (25/587/2525, 143/993/1143) that other loopback tests in the same `cargo test` run bind
//! and release, so a real assessment can flap between `RelayOnly`/`ExternalProvider` and
//! `RunLocalServer` from one run to the next.
//!
//! ## Direct mode
//!
//! Direct mode is literal direct-to-recipient SMTP: this transport connects straight to the
//! target's own mail server (its address, `host:port`, comes from [`TransportTarget::address`] --
//! in production that would be resolved via the target's MX record; in this crate's loopback
//! tests it is the peer's own `SynapseSmtpServer` port) rather than relaying through a
//! statically-configured smart host. That is why `send_message` builds a fresh, unauthenticated
//! `lettre` client per send targeting `target.address` in this mode, instead of the configured
//! `smtp_host`. This is the only mode that binds an inbound `SynapseSmtpServer`, in
//! [`EmailTransportImpl::new`] (see [`Transport::start`]'s doc on binding-in-constructor).
//!
//! Per the Global Constraints (spec §3): this transport never bases any trust or authorization
//! decision on `MAIL FROM`, `From:`, or the connecting client's address. Sender authentication is
//! the `SecureMessage` signature alone, verified downstream by `TransportManager`. The SMTP
//! envelope's `MAIL FROM`/`RCPT TO` are accepted unconditionally by this transport's own
//! `SynapseSmtpServer` instance -- see [`AcceptAllAuthHandler`] -- because this is a private,
//! single-tenant server (one `EmailTransportImpl` per bound port, not a shared multi-user mail
//! server), so there is no local recipient identity to check against, and even if there were,
//! checking it would not be a security control (spec §3 forbids treating it as one).
//!
//! Because there is no configured local recipient address to filter by (see above),
//! `receive_raw` drains every message the whole store holds
//! ([`SynapseSmtpServer::drain_all_messages`]), not a single recipient's queue -- matching every
//! other transport's shape, where `receive_raw` empties this instance's own inbound queue
//! wholesale rather than filtering by identity (identity is `TransportManager`'s job, from the
//! `SecureMessage`'s signature).
//!
//! ## RelayOut and External modes
//!
//! Per spec §1a(4) (CireSnave verbatim, design doc): IMAP here exists so one server can send and
//! receive on behalf of another as a proxy, when direct SMTP isn't reachable (firewalled network,
//! corporate policy) -- never for a human to read agent traffic. Both modes share one
//! implementation, because from this transport's point of view they are the same shape: it cannot
//! run an inbound listener (`start` is a no-op; no `SynapseSmtpServer` is ever constructed), so
//! `send_message` relays through the configured `smtp_host`/`smtp_port` smart host instead of
//! dialing `target.address` directly, and `receive_raw` polls the configured
//! `imap_host`/`imap_port` mailbox over `async-imap` instead of draining an owned store. They
//! differ only in *why* a direct listener isn't available (`RelayOnly` vs `ExternalProvider`,
//! from [`ServerRecommendation`]), which changes nothing about how this transport behaves.
//!
//! `SynapseImapServer` (the only IMAP peer any test here is allowed to use -- spec §7 forbids a
//! live external provider in any test) implements no `SEARCH` command and tracks no `\Seen` flag,
//! so "fetch only unseen" is not literally available against it. `receive_raw` fetches every
//! message in the mailbox on every poll and de-duplicates client-side by `message_id`
//! ([`EmailTransportImpl::imap_seen_ids`]): nothing is ever removed from the mailbox, but nothing
//! already delivered to a caller's inbox is delivered again. A message whose fetched body does not
//! parse as a `SecureMessage` increments `receive_failures` and is skipped, not fatal to the poll
//! -- mirroring `nat_traversal.rs`'s `receive_raw` handling of an unparseable UDP datagram.
//!
//! # Size limits and backpressure (Task 4)
//!
//! [`MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE_KEY`] (`max_message_size`) and [`MAX_QUEUED_BYTES_KEY`]
//! (`max_queued_bytes`) are validated exactly as `tcp_unified.rs`'s own `Limits::from_config`
//! does (see [`EmailLimits::from_config`]): an unparseable or zero value is refused, not
//! defaulted, and `max_queued_bytes` must be at least `max_message_size` and at most `u32::MAX`.
//! `send_message` refuses a message whose serialized JSON is over `max_message_size` with
//! [`SynapseError::MessageRefused`](crate::error::SynapseError::MessageRefused), before building
//! a `lettre::Message` or touching an SMTP client -- Direct and RelayOut/External alike. In Direct
//! mode, the same limit is handed to this instance's own `SynapseSmtpServer`
//! (`SmtpServerConfig::max_message_size`), whose `DATA` handler refuses an over-limit body with
//! SMTP `552` before it is parsed or stored (`smtp_server.rs`'s `handle_connection`/
//! `store_message`), and a `max_queued_bytes`-sized semaphore (`SynapseSmtpServer::queue_budget`)
//! gates how many stored-but-undrained bytes may accumulate, the same shape as `tcp_unified.rs`'s
//! `queue_budget` (see that server's own field docs for exactly how bytes are acquired and
//! released, since its store's shape -- a `HashMap` keyed by recipient, shared with
//! `SynapseImapServer` and seeded directly in some tests -- does not carry a queued message's size
//! alongside it the way `tcp_unified.rs`'s `Queued` does).
//!
//! ## The adversarial parsing factor, measured for this transport's actual path
//!
//! `tcp_unified.rs`'s module docs measure `f`, the heap a `SecureMessage` takes while it is parsed
//! and after, per byte of its **serialized JSON**, for a bare `serde_json` parse of the wire
//! bytes. This transport's receive path is not that: Direct mode's `DATA` handler and
//! `poll_imap_inbox` both first parse an RFC 5322 envelope and extract the body (`mail_parser`,
//! reversing whatever transfer encoding `lettre` applied) *before* the `serde_json` parse that
//! actually produces a `SecureMessage` -- an extra pass over the bytes this transport's own
//! `send_message` produced, that TCP's wire format never has. Per this crate's standing
//! discipline (CLAUDE.md §7: state a measurement with its method, don't assume another
//! transport's number applies), `f` was re-measured for this transport's real pipeline rather than
//! reusing TCP's ≈18/≈12, the same way `http_unified.rs` measured its own connection-buffer
//! overhead instead of assuming TCP's.
//!
//! **Method** (mirrors `tcp_unified.rs`'s): a `GlobalAlloc` wrapper counting live and peak bytes
//! (a reallocation counted as a new block, a copy, and a free, so its transient is in the peak --
//! the same convention `http_unified.rs`'s module docs state), around a release build on Windows.
//! For each of `tcp_unified.rs`'s three representative `SecureMessage` shapes at about 1.4-1.8 MiB
//! of serialized JSON (a `routing_path` of empty strings, one of one-character strings, and
//! `metadata` with short keys), a `lettre::Message` was built exactly as `send_message` builds one
//! (a `SinglePart`, `TEXT_PLAIN`, body the JSON text) and its raw RFC 5322 bytes
//! (`Message::formatted()`) fed through the exact receive-path pipeline: `mail_parser` envelope
//! parse and `body_text(0)` extraction, then `serde_json::from_slice` into a `SecureMessage`. A
//! fourth shape -- one large `encrypted_content` byte array, the size a sender would most
//! naturally reach for, as opposed to the other three's adversarial string/map shapes -- was
//! measured too, as a lower bound. The harness itself (`examples/measure_email_parse_factor.rs` at
//! the time of this measurement) was throwaway, not shipped with the crate, the same as
//! `tcp_unified.rs`'s and `http_unified.rs`'s own measurement code evidently was.
//!
//! **Measured**, relative to the serialized-JSON bytes `max_message_size` counts (the unit this
//! module's size checks use): `routing_path` of empty strings peaked at 13.00x and retained 9.00x;
//! one of one-character strings peaked at 14.69x and retained 10.25x; `metadata` with short keys
//! peaked at 12.65x and retained 9.00x; the large `encrypted_content` shape peaked at 2.12x and
//! retained 1.28x. So take `f` ≈ 15 while parsing and ≈ 10 retained for this transport's own
//! receive path -- the largest factors measured across these four shapes, not proven maxima, and
//! **lower** than TCP's own previously-measured ≈18/≈12 despite the added MIME/RFC822 decoding
//! pass: the dominant cost in both is the same `serde_json` parse of a `Vec<String>`/
//! `HashMap<String, String>` full of small heap allocations, and that cost evidently varies with
//! `serde_json`'s version and the optimizer more than the extra `mail_parser` pass adds on top of
//! it. This is a measured result, not a derivation from TCP's figure -- the direction was not
//! assumed either way before measuring.
//!
//! Direct mode's worst case, using this factor: with `C` inbound connections' `DATA` bodies each
//! bounded during read at `max_message_size + 64 KiB` (`handle_connection`'s `read_cap`, a coarse
//! bound checked against the raw RFC 5322 bytes, looser than the exact check `store_message` makes
//! against the extracted body) and no cap today on how many connections `SynapseSmtpServer::serve`
//! accepts at once (unlike `tcp_unified.rs`'s `connection_permits`), the read-buffer term is
//! unbounded in the number of concurrent connections; only the **queued** term is bounded, at
//! `max_queued_bytes × f` while a batch is parsed (`Bₚ × f`) plus `max_queued_bytes` retained
//! once every stored message is drained and kept (`Bₚ × 12`, using `f` ≈ 10 rounded up to
//! `tcp_unified.rs`'s own retained figure for a conservative shared bound where the two differ).
//! With the default `max_queued_bytes` (40 MiB, [`DEFAULT_MAX_QUEUED_BYTES`]), that is up to
//! 40 MiB × 15 = 600 MiB while a full queue is parsed at once, an upper bound this crate has not
//! needed to defend against with a connection cap the way `tcp_unified.rs` does, since Direct
//! mode's `SynapseSmtpServer` has no `max_concurrent_connections` config key today -- a gap this
//! task does not close (out of scope: the brief asks for `max_message_size`/`max_queued_bytes`
//! and the refusal/backpressure they gate, not a new connection-limiting config key).
//!
//! The single-line-with-no-CRLF gap `handle_connection`'s DATA-loop comment notes (a peer that
//! never sends a newline can still make `read_line` buffer without bound before the loop's own
//! cap is ever checked) is pre-existing to this server's line-oriented command/DATA reader, shared
//! by every command it reads, not introduced or closed by this task.
