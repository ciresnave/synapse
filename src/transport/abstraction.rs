/// A write-only sink for raw, unverified messages coming off a transport.
///
/// This is how [`TransportReceive::receive_raw`] is sealed: not with a token guarding the
/// *call* (a token is just a value -- `'static + Send + Sync`, so it can be stashed in a static
/// or handed on to any other transport a caller can reach, which would let a malicious
/// implementation read straight through another transport's `receive_raw`), but by controlling
/// what the call can *do*. A `RawInbox` can be written to by anyone holding a `&mut` reference
/// ([`push`](Self::push), [`extend`](Self::extend) are `pub`), but it can only be *constructed*
/// or *read back* from inside this crate: [`new`](Self::new) and [`drain`](Self::drain) are
/// `pub(crate)`. It deliberately implements none of `Clone`, `Default`, `Debug`, `Deref`, or
/// `IntoIterator` -- any of those would either let outside code manufacture one or let it read
/// contents back out. So an external implementation of `receive_raw` can push its own transport's
/// messages into the inbox it was handed, and can forward that same `&mut RawInbox` to another
/// transport it wraps or decorates (whose messages then land in the same inbox, still headed for
/// verification) -- but it has no way to conjure an inbox of its own to bait a call, and no way to
/// look inside the one it was given to steal what another transport already deposited there.
