//! Roles (M3): a role is a stable identity that a restarted session takes over.
//!
//! A session claims `role@account` by signing a short, domain-separated text with the role's key.
//! The role certificate (M2's keystore, f1's [`AgentCertificate`]) binds that key to the role, so
//! holding the key is the authorization. The newest valid claim always wins and gets a strictly
//! increasing **epoch**; any call made under an older epoch gets [`Superseded`].
//!
//! No I/O and no clock: `now` is passed in. M4 persists [`RolesState`]; M5's daemon calls this.
//! Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-01-m3-roles-design.md`.
