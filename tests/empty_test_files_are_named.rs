//! **The empty-test-file list in `TEST_VALIDATION_AUDIT_REPORT.md` must match the tree.**
//!
//! That report names three files as EMPTY. Measured at `7b80ca4`, two of the
//! three genuinely were — **so it described that tree correctly.** It was
//! committed at `f0f570c` eleven months later, and **that same commit refilled
//! two of them and emptied a third.**
//!
//! ⚠️ **The report was ACCURATE WHEN WRITTEN AND FALSIFIED BY ITS OWN
//! PUBLICATION.** Neither standard remedy fits: a supersession banner implies it
//! was current and drifted (it never was current here, not for one commit), and
//! a correction implies it was wrong on arrival (it was not). **What it lacked
//! was its REF** — *"several files are empty"* where it should have said *"at
//! `7b80ca4`, these files were empty."*
//!
//! # ⚠️ EMPTINESS IS MEASURED BY CONTENT, NOT BY BYTE COUNT, AND THAT IS NOT A DETAIL
//!
//! These files hold a single newline. **In git's LF blobs that is 1 byte; in a
//! Windows working tree with CRLF it is 2.** A guard written as `len <= 1`
//! answers differently depending on where it reads from, and would have reported
//! **zero** empty files on the tree where four are empty. **This one strips
//! whitespace and asks whether anything remains**, which cannot drift with line
//! endings.
//!
//! # What is pinned, and why it is not the report's sentence
//!
//! The original claim is deliberately KEPT — it is the record of what was
//! measured and when. **So "the report says X is empty" cannot be the failure
//! condition**, or correcting the document would redden this guard forever.
//! **The correction states the CURRENT empty set, and this test holds that
//! statement to the tree.** Empty a file or fill one, and it reddens until the
//! document is updated.
