# Trust System Security Audit

## Overview

This document contains a security audit of the Synapse Trust System, which implements a dual-trust model:

1. Entity-to-entity trust (subjective, based on direct interactions)
2. Network trust (objective, blockchain-verified)

## Critical Findings

### Input Validation Issues

1. **Score Range Validation**: In `trust_manager.rs`, the `submit_trust_report` function accepts scores from -100 to +100, but there's no explicit validation to ensure the input falls within this range.

2. **SQL Injection Vulnerability**: The trust manager uses raw SQL queries with parameterized inputs, but some complex queries might benefit from additional validation.

3. **Evidence Data Sanitization**: When submitting reports with evidence, there is no sanitization or size limiting of evidence data.

### Cryptographic Implementation

1. **Trust Propagation Algorithm**: The current implementation uses a simplified approach without proper cryptographic verification of trust chains.

2. **Missing Replay Protection**: When submitting trust reports to the blockchain, there is no protection against replay attacks.

### Access Control Issues

1. **Trust Report Authorization**: Anyone can submit trust reports about any participant without verification of a legitimate relationship.

2. **Missing Rate Limiting**: No protection against spamming trust reports to manipulate scores.

### Secure Storage

1. **Trust Balance Protection**: Trust balances are stored without additional encryption or integrity protection.

## Recommendations

### Critical (Must Fix)

1. Add explicit validation for all trust score inputs to ensure they fall within the valid range.

   ```rust
   if score < -100 || score > 100 {
       return Err(anyhow::anyhow!("Trust score must be between -100 and 100"));
   }
   ```

2. Implement proper authorization checks before accepting trust reports:

   ```rust
   // Verify reporter has interacted with subject
   let has_interaction = self.verify_interaction_history(reporter_id, subject_id).await?;
   if !has_interaction && score < 0 {
       return Err(anyhow::anyhow!("Cannot submit negative report without prior interaction"));
   }
   ```

3. Add rate limiting to prevent abuse:

   ```rust
   // Check if reporter has submitted too many reports recently
   let recent_reports = self.count_recent_reports(reporter_id, Duration::hours(24)).await?;
   if recent_reports > MAX_DAILY_REPORTS {
       return Err(anyhow::anyhow!("Rate limit exceeded"));
   }
   ```

4. Implement proper replay protection for blockchain transactions:

   ```rust
   // Add nonce to trust report transactions
   let nonce = self.blockchain.get_next_nonce(reporter_id).await?;
   ```

### High Priority

1. Enhance the trust propagation algorithm with cryptographic verification.

2. Add evidence validation and size limiting:

   ```rust
   if let Some(ref evidence) = evidence {
       if evidence.len() > MAX_EVIDENCE_SIZE {
           return Err(anyhow::anyhow!("Evidence size exceeds limit"));
       }
       // Sanitize evidence content
   }
   ```

3. Implement secure storage for trust balances with integrity protection.

### Medium Priority

1. Add audit logging for all trust operations.

2. Implement regular automatic security reviews of trust algorithm parameters.

## Implementation Plan

1. Create and apply patches for all critical issues.
2. Implement rate limiting for all trust operations.
3. Enhance the trust propagation algorithm.
4. Add comprehensive logging and monitoring.

## Conclusion

The trust system requires several security enhancements before it can be considered production-ready. All critical issues should be addressed immediately, followed by high and medium priority items.
