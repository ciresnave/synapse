### 🎯 Key Features Implemented

#### 🧠 Neural Identity Resolution
```rust
// Contextual participant discovery
let query = ContactSearchQuery {
    query: "AI assistant for code analysis".to_string(),
    hints: vec!["coding".to_string(), "analysis".to_string()],
    min_trust_score: Some(70.0),
    // ...
};
let results = synapse.registry.search_participants(&query).await?;
```

#### 🏛️ Dual Trust System
```rust
// Submit trust report with staking
let report_id = synapse.trust_manager.submit_trust_report(
    "reporter@company.com",
    "subject@ai-lab.edu", 
    85,                        // Score
    TrustCategory::Technical,
    20,                        // Stake amount
    Some("Excellent work"),
).await?;

// Get combined trust score (entity + network)
let trust_score = synapse.trust_manager.get_trust_score(
    "subject@ai-lab.edu",
    "requester@company.com",
).await?;
```

#### 🔐 Privacy Controls
```rust
// Four privacy levels implemented
pub enum DiscoverabilityLevel {
    Public,    // Anyone can discover
    Unlisted,  // Discoverable with hints/referrals
    Private,   // Direct contact only
    Stealth,   // Invisible unless pre-authorized
}
```

#### ⛓️ Blockchain Trust Verification
```rust
// Blockchain operations
let blockchain_stats = synapse.blockchain.get_stats().await?;
let trust_score = synapse.blockchain.get_trust_score(participant_id).await?;

// Staking operations
let stake_id = synapse.blockchain.staking_manager.stake_points(
    participant_id, amount, StakePurpose::TrustReporting
).await?;
```
