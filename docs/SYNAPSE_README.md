> **A revolutionary neural communication network for AI entities, distributed systems, and modern applications with federated identity management, dual trust systems, and privacy-respecting discovery.**

## üåü What is Synapse?

Synapse is a cutting-edge communication system that transforms how AI entities, applications, and distributed systems interact across the internet. Built on a foundation of federated identity management and blockchain-verified trust, Synapse provides:

- **üåç Federated Network**: Cross-organizational communication spanning platforms
- **üîí Privacy-First**: Advanced privacy controls with stealth and unlisted modes
- **‚ö° Intelligent Routing**: Multi-speed communication with smart transport selection
- **ü§ñ AI-Native Design**: Optimized for AI-to-AI and human-to-AI interaction
- **üèõÔ∏è Dual Trust System**: Entity-to-entity and blockchain-verified network trust
- **üîç Contextual Discovery**: Natural contact patterns with intelligent name resolution

## üéØ Key Innovation: Neural Identity Resolution

Synapse's most powerful feature is its **contextual identity system**. You can discover and contact participants using natural language descriptions:

```rust
// Instead of requiring exact contact details...
send_to("alice.smith@university.edu", message).await?;

// Use natural, contextual discovery
let contacts = synapse.discover_participants(ContactQuery {
    description: "AI researcher at Stanford working on machine learning",
    hints: vec!["university", "stanford", "ml"],
    requester: "my_bot@company.com",
}).await?;
```

### How Neural Discovery Works

1. **Contextual Hints**: `"AI researcher"`, `"Stanford"`, `"machine learning"`
2. **Smart Matching**: Multi-layer discovery with privacy filtering
3. **Trust Verification**: Blockchain-verified trust scores and entity-to-entity ratings
4. **Privacy Respect**: Honor participant privacy preferences and discoverability levels

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Dual Trust System

Synapse implements a revolutionary **dual trust architecture**:

#### ü§ù Entity-to-Entity Trust (Subjective)
- Personal experience between specific participants
- Contextual ratings (communication, technical skill, reliability)
- Relationship-based trust scores
- Private, subjective assessments

#### ‚õìÔ∏è Network Trust (Objective, Blockchain-Verified)
- Community-verified trust through blockchain consensus
- Trust point staking system with real consequences
- Vouching mechanism: risk your points to report on others
- Automatic decay prevents trust point hoarding
- Encourages continued good behavior

### Privacy Levels

Synapse supports four distinct privacy levels:

- **üåç Public**: Anyone can discover, appears in searches
- **üìù Unlisted**: Discoverable through referrals/hints but not in general searches
- **üîí Private**: Not discoverable, direct contact only (requires exact info)
- **üëª Stealth**: Completely invisible, even direct attempts fail unless pre-authorized

### Participant Types

- **üë§ Human**: Researchers, developers, users
- **ü§ñ AI Model**: GPT-4, Claude, custom AI systems
- **‚öôÔ∏è Service**: APIs, microservices, bots
- **üè¢ Organization**: Companies, departments, teams

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic Setup

```rust
use synapse::{SynapseNode, SynapseConfig, ParticipantProfile, EntityType};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Configure Synapse node
    let config = SynapseConfig {
        database_url: "postgresql://localhost/synapse".to_string(),
        redis_url: "redis://localhost:6379".to_string(),
        node_id: "my_node".to_string(),
        ..Default::default()
    };
    
    // Create and start Synapse node
    let synapse = SynapseNode::new(config).await?;
    synapse.start().await?;
    
    // Register your AI assistant
    let profile = ParticipantProfile {
        global_id: "my_ai@company.com".to_string(),
        display_name: "My AI Assistant".to_string(),
        entity_type: EntityType::AiModel,
        // ... other fields
    };
    
    synapse.registry.register_participant(profile).await?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### Contextual Discovery

```rust
// Search for AI models with specific capabilities
let query = ContactSearchQuery {
    query: "AI assistant for code analysis".to_string(),
    requester_id: "my_bot@company.com".to_string(),
    hints: vec!["coding".to_string(), "analysis".to_string()],
    min_trust_score: Some(70.0), // Only high-trust participants
    ..Default::default()
};

let participants = synapse.registry.search_participants(&query).await?;
for participant in participants {
    println!("Found: {} ({})", participant.display_name, participant.global_id);
}
```

### Trust System Operations

```rust
// Submit a trust report (stake trust points)
let report_id = synapse.trust_manager.submit_trust_report(
    "my_bot@company.com",      // Reporter
    "helpful_ai@service.com",  // Subject
    85,                        // Score (0-100)
    TrustCategory::Technical,  // Category
    20,                        // Stake amount (trust points)
    Some("Excellent code analysis and helpful responses".to_string()),
).await?;

// Check combined trust score
let trust_score = synapse.trust_manager.get_trust_score(
    "helpful_ai@service.com",  // Subject
    "my_bot@company.com",      // Requester (for entity-to-entity component)
).await?;

println!("Trust score: {:.2}/100", trust_score);
```

## üìö Core Concepts

### Participant Registry

The heart of Synapse is its **federated participant registry**:

- **Rich Profiles**: Store capabilities, roles, organizational context
- **Multiple Identities**: Professional, personal, service contexts
- **Privacy Controls**: Fine-grained discoverability and contact preferences
- **Availability Status**: Universal availability (not just for experts)

### Blockchain Trust System

Synapse includes a **custom blockchain** designed specifically for trust verification:

- **Trust Reports**: Participants stake trust points to vouch for others
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Network validates reports through consensus
- **Staking System**: Risk your trust points for the right to participate
- **Automatic Decay**: Trust points decay over time to prevent hoarding
- **Slashing**: False reports result in stake slashing

### Discovery Services

Smart discovery that respects privacy while enabling natural contact patterns:

- **Multi-layer Lookup**: Name resolution through multiple strategies
- **Contextual Hints**: Use organization, role, topic, and capability hints
- **Privacy Filtering**: Automatic filtering based on discoverability settings
- **Trust Requirements**: Filter results by minimum trust thresholds

## üåê Federation and Integration

### Cross-Organizational Trust

Synapse is designed for **federated operation** across organizations:

- **Trust Domains**: Organizations can maintain their own trust policies
- **Cross-Domain Discovery**: Find participants across organizational boundaries
- **Delegation**: Forward queries to appropriate organizational registries
- **Email Integration**: Fall back to email for universal reach

### API Integration

```rust
// REST API endpoints (planned)
GET /api/v1/participants/search?q=AI+researcher&org=university
POST /api/v1/participants/register
PUT /api/v1/trust/report
GET /api/v1/trust/score/{participant_id}
```

### Email Compatibility

Synapse maintains compatibility with existing email infrastructure:

- **Email Addresses**: All participant IDs are valid email addresses
- **SMTP Integration**: Send messages via email when direct connection unavailable
- **PGP Encryption**: Seamless encryption for email-based communication

## üîê Security and Privacy

### Privacy by Design

- **Discoverability Control**: Four-level privacy system
- **Minimal Disclosure**: Only share necessary information for discovery
- **Consent-Based**: Explicit consent for contact and data sharing
- **Right to Deletion**: Participants can remove themselves completely

### Security Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All messages encrypted with recipient's public key
- **Digital Signatures**: Verify sender authenticity and message integrity
- **Trust Verification**: Blockchain-based verification of trust claims
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse and spam
- **Audit Trails**: Complete audit trail of all trust operations

## üìä Monitoring and Analytics

### Trust Analytics

```rust
// Get trust statistics
let stats = synapse.trust_manager.get_participant_stats("ai@company.com").await?;
println!("Trust balance: {} points", stats.trust_balance);
println!("Average rating: {:.2}/100", stats.average_rating);
println!("Total interactions: {}", stats.interaction_count);
```

### Blockchain Monitoring

```rust
// Monitor blockchain health
let blockchain_stats = synapse.blockchain.get_stats().await?;
println!("Blocks: {}", blockchain_stats.block_count);
