## 🔧 Architecture Highlights

### Transport Selection Intelligence
```rust
pub enum TransportSelectionPolicy {
    FirstAvailable,      // Use first working transport
    UrgencyBased,        // Select based on message urgency
    PerformanceBased,    // Choose best-performing transport
    Adaptive,            // ML-style learning from past performance
    RoundRobin,          // Distribute load evenly
    PreferenceOrder,     // Honor target preferences
}
```

### Message Urgency Levels
```rust
pub enum MessageUrgency {
    Critical,     // < 100ms latency required
    RealTime,     // < 1s latency preferred  
    Interactive,  // < 5s latency acceptable
    Background,   // > 5s latency acceptable
    Batch,        // Store and forward acceptable
}
```

### Transport Capabilities
```rust
pub struct TransportCapabilities {
    pub max_message_size: usize,
    pub reliable: bool,
    pub real_time: bool,
    pub broadcast: bool,
    pub bidirectional: bool,
    pub encrypted: bool,
    pub network_spanning: bool,
    pub supported_urgencies: Vec<MessageUrgency>,
}
```

### Failover Configuration
```rust
pub struct FailoverConfig {
    pub enabled: bool,
    pub max_retries: u32,
    pub retry_delay: Duration,
    pub max_retry_delay: Duration,
    pub failure_threshold: f64,
    pub recovery_timeout: Duration,
}
```
