A SWEEP DOES NOT FIX A PROPERTY THAT REGROWS. `fuel` stamped 795 files on
2026-08-19 and had drifted to 823/833 by 2026-09-10 -- not because anything was
undone, but because ten files were added afterwards and nothing was watching.
The sweep is the one-off; this is the part that lasts.

WHAT THIS REFUSES TO DO, AND WHY EACH ONE IS DELIBERATE:

  * It never WRITES. A gate that repairs the thing it measures reports success
    forever and tells you nothing about whether anyone is maintaining it.

  * It never treats a DIFFERENT identifier as a failure to be corrected.
    `fuel-examples/src/bs1770.rs` is a verbatim Apache-2.0-ONLY third-party
    work, and fuel's blanket sweep stamped `MIT OR Apache-2.0` onto it --
    asserting a licence grant nobody made. Files whose licence is somebody
    else's decision belong in HOLDOUT below, by name, with a reason.

  * It refuses to pass on an EMPTY population. `0 of 0 files` is 100% compliant
    by arithmetic and means the glob matched nothing -- a renamed directory, a
    moved workspace, a typo in an extension. The comforting number and the
    broken query are the same number, and nobody audits good news.

#:     git grep -l -i copyright -- ':!*.md' ':!*LICEN[SC]E*'      -> 1 file
#:       and that one file is THIS SCRIPT, whose comments discuss copyright.
#:
#: ⚠️ THE DETECTOR COUNTED ITSELF. Third time in this project: an SPDX checker

#: constant, and a spelling census reported a Python test fixture as a licence.
#: A TOOL THAT SEARCHES FOR A WORD IS A FILE CONTAINING THAT WORD.
